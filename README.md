## Validation Approach

The validation process relied heavily on a combination of HTML and CSS for initial validation, with JavaScript used to enhance and refine the process. This approach ensured that email addresses were formatted correctly before being submitted. Additional validations included checking that the first and last names were longer than two characters and that the password did not contain spaces and had a length greater than six.

### Problems Encountered

During the CLAIM TRIAL project, I encountered several challenges while implementing the validation form.I thought I would need to use only JavaScript for validation. However, after reviewing the HTML and CSS, I discovered errors in the CSS `:not(:valid)` pseudo-class. I fixed these issues and successfully utilized a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the final validation process.

To further enhance the validation process, I implemented additional JavaScript logic to improve accuracy. By combining these elements, I successfully created a robust validation form.

## Lessons Learned

One of the biggest lessons I learned from this project is that using HTML and CSS for form validation can simplify the process, rather than relying solely on JavaScript. Integrating HTML and CSS can make tasks more manageable. Additionally, I realized the importance of testing early and often, as it helps catch problems before they become significant issues.
